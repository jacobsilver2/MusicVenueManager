Confirm:
- [x] The application is pretty DRY
- [x] Limited logic in controllers
  acts_controller#create has more logic than any other controller method, but does use a private method to do a bunch of heavy lifting.
- [ ] Views use helper methods if appropriate
- [x] Views use partials if appropriate
